In this project I have created employee bean class and and hibernate.cfg.xml file where all the details is given for this bean class.
this employee class  the table is created in the database.
in main class I read the object of bean class variables through parameterized constructor and save it in the database. then I perform CRUD operation.
Created and inserted data, then upadate data, then deleting a row based on primary key. and lasly I used to display all the data on console.
